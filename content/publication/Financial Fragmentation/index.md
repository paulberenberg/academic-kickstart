# Abstract.
abstract = "We  describe  differing  degrees  of  financial  market  integration  in the euro  area,  identifying  a  clear  pattern of  disintegration  on  the  aggregate  level,  as  well  as  in the  most  important  financial  markets,  after  the  euro  area  crisis.  We show  that  fragmentation has declined since 2012 but the situation is still fragile. We further identify  the  main  factors  for  financial  fragmentation  and  close  with  some  policy  proposals, necessary for completing the European economic and monetary Union."
