# Abstract.
abstract = "I study effects of cross-border financial integration in stocks, bonds, and bank loans on output co-movement. Using bilateral data on cross-border portfolio asset and bank loan holdings for 58 economies from 2001-2015, I combine simultaneous equation estimation with standard instruments to disentangle the main drivers of bilateral output co-movement. I find that effects of financial integration depend on types of asset integration and reverse when country-level financial fragility, measured by indicators of financial stress, is high: In times of low financial fragility, greater stock market integration leads to less GDP co-movement. Greater bilateral bond/loan market integration increases co-movement. Increasing country-level financial fragility reverses the signs of all effects. Without controlling for country-level financial fragility, signs and magnitude of effects vary across time and geography. Opposite signs of stock and bond/loan integration effects across all specifications suggest that stock market integration acts as a buffer to global output co-movement effects induced by bond/loan market integration."
